This project implements a user registration and login system as part of the Programming 1A PoE (Proof of Evidence). The main objective is to demonstrate foundational programming skills using object-oriented principles, input validation, and basic user authentication. The system ensures that all user inputs meet specific requirements, with clear feedback provided for both successful and unsuccessful attempts.

    -Password must be at least eight characters, with a capital letter, a number, and a special character.
    -Cell phone number must include the international code (e.g., +27) and be no more than 10 digits after the code.

Installation:

  -Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans).
  -Ensure you have Java 17 or later installed.
  -Build the project using your IDE or with Maven/Gradle if configured.
